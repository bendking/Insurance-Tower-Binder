# Insurtech-Tower-Binding

Note that due to time contraints I've cut some corners. This was approved by Naor.

For example, I used a file-based storage solution instead of interfacing with a DB, and made the app only interact with a single tower instead of dynamically altering a specific tower based on ID, etc.

I noted in the project files where I could have made a more resilient, scalable solution if this were a user-facing application.
